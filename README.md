# Ace Extension For Quarto

By default, [Ace editor](https://ace.c9.io) does not integrate well with the dynamic scaling in [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) presentations, breaking text sizing and selection.

This `revealjs-plugin` for Quarto implements a workaround, originally provided by [Gottox/reveal.js-ace](https://github.com/Gottox/reveal.js-ace).


## Installing

```bash
quarto add georgestagg/quarto-ace-revealjs
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory.
If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

## Example

A minimal example presentation can be found at: [example.qmd](example.qmd).
